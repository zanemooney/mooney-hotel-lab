## User Story (points = ðŸ‘• sm) 

**As A** data enterer person  

**I want** a nice, clean, logical web form

**So that** I can give you my data! 

## Comments / Narrative
- create a new, single web page
- make up some name or reason for your user, a store or signup for underwater team bingo. 
  - page should have enough info to inform/guide the user
- create the interface and style 
  - (no '<script>' needed this time!...but do have a place for it...initialize jQuerry)
- set up a good dir structure, naming, repo, and all that 
- use bootstrap5 classes first (before making your own style)
- include the gamut of '<input>' and data types: 
  - text entry: name, numbers (eg. ph#, credit, SSN), password (show it!?), email
  - date and time
  - check and option boxes 
  - buttons 
  - flow control ones (if I select this, I get this option) 
  - clear, submit
  - default input, help info, examples
